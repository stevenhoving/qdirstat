     * This collects file size data for trees or subtrees for later use for
     * calculating a median or quantiles or histograms.
     *
     * Notice that one data item (one FileSize, i.e. one 64 bit long long) is
     * stored for each file (or each matching file) in this object, so this is
     * expensive in terms of memory usage. Also, since data usually need to be
     * sorted for those calculations and sorting has at least logarithmic cost
     * O( n * log(n) ), this also has heavy performance impact.
