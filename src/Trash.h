/**
 * This class implements the XDG Trash specification:
 *
 *     http://standards.freedesktop.org/trash-spec/trashspec-1.0.html
 *
 * Basically, this is a desktop trashcan that works just like the trashcan in
 * KDE, Gnome, Xfce and other major Linux desktops. It should integrate well
 * with any of them, i.e., files or directories moved to this trash can should
 * appear in the desktop's native trashcan implementation (the window you get
 * when you click on the trashcan icon on the desktop or in the file manager).
 *
 * Most of the important functions of this class are static. They use the
 * singleton of this class internally that can be accessed with instance().
