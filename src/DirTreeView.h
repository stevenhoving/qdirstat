     * This is a thin wrapper around TreeView that takes care about basic setup
     * and configuration of the tree view and adds support for synchronizing
     * current / selected items between the DirTree, the DirTreeMap and this
     * DirTreeView.
     *
     * The Qt model / view abstraction is kept up as good as possible, but this
     * widget is really meant to be used with a QDirStat::DirTreeModel and not
     * just any random subclass of QAbstractItemModel.
